# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1

# One Node process serves everything: the Vite-built 3D client from
# client/dist, the JSON API, and README.md rendered at /readme/. It listens on
# 0.0.0.0:$PORT (fly.toml sets PORT) and keeps its SQLite file on the /data
# volume that fly.toml mounts. fly.toml sets no DATABASE_PATH, so it's set
# here: without it the file landed in the container's own disk, which is wiped
# on every deploy and every auto-stop, and poops vanished.
