# Process overview

<!-- TEMPLATE: this file is a shape to fill in, not a form. Replace everything
     in it with your own overview, and delete this comment — `pnpm
     check:evidence` will remind you if it's still here. -->

A reading-guide to how the work came together --- a map to your process, not an
essay about it. Markers read this file and follow its citations; they don't
trawl the repo for evidence you didn't point at, so if a moment mattered, cite
it.

This file is the shape; the course site's
[assessment page](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/topics/assessment/#what-you-submit)
is the requirement, and its
[word counts](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/topics/assessment/#word-counts)
cover every deliverable.

## What I built

One paragraph: the thing, and the idea behind it.

## The moments that mattered

Three or four for an assignment; fewer is fine for a weekly prototype. Keep the
list short so each moment has room to do all four jobs:

1. **what happened** --- the problem, or the thing the agent got wrong
2. **what you did instead of the obvious thing** --- the call you made, and why
   it beat the obvious one
3. **how you knew it was right** --- the check you ran, the viewport you looked
   at, what you read before accepting the diff
4. **the citation** --- a commit or commit range, a `CLAUDE.md` change, a check
   that went from red to green, a prompt paired with the commit it produced

Jobs 2 and 3 are the ones the repo can't tell a reader on its own, so they're
where the marks are. The strongest moments are the ones where a correction
landed in the **harness** rather than in another prompt --- a rule added to
`CLAUDE.md`, a check wired up, an attempt thrown away: re-prompting until it
passes is the routine case, and changing what the agent works against is the
skilled one.

Cite each moment as a link whose text is the commit hash or range and whose
target is this repo's commit or compare URL, so a reader clicks straight to the
evidence:

- one commit: [`a1b2c3d`](https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/commit/a1b2c3d)
- a range:
  [`a1b2c3d...e4f5a6b`](https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/compare/a1b2c3d...e4f5a6b)

To pair a prompt with the commit it produced, quote the prompt (curated, not a
full transcript) next to the citation:

> the prompt, verbatim

Screenshots are welcome where one carries the verification better than a
sentence does. Commit the file to this repo and link it with a **relative**
path, which is what makes it render on GitHub: `![alt text](docs/before.png)`.
Images don't count towards the word count and don't replace the citation.

### A worked moment, for shape

Delete this section along with the rest of the boilerplate --- it's here to show
the four jobs in one paragraph, not to be imitated in content.

> The date formatter kept coming back with `toLocaleDateString()` and no locale
> argument, so the same build rendered differently on my machine and in CI. I'd
> already re-prompted it twice, which fixed the line but not the habit, so the
> third time I put the rule in `CLAUDE.md` instead
> ([`3f9ac21`](https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/commit/3f9ac21)) and added
> a spec test that fails on a bare `toLocaleDateString`. That's what told me it
> had actually taken: the test went red against the old code and green against
> the new, and the next two features it wrote passed it without prompting
> ([`3f9ac21...b7e0d14`](https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/compare/3f9ac21...b7e0d14)).

## Before you ship

`pnpm check:evidence` verifies your citations resolve to real commits, that the
current reflection entry is in `reflections/`, and that your `CLAUDE.md` is
there --- before a marker ever opens the file. It checks that your map is
traceable, not that it is good: the marker judges whether your small,
deliberately chosen set of moments shows real judgement and reflection. A green
check is not a substitute for that curation.

Images are deliberately not checked, because whether one renders is visible the
moment you look. Open this file on GitHub and look at it before you ship.
